I'm getting ready to consider 2k (not 4k) for a main monitor 

But, I don't want to spend too much

7:27 PM
Have you tried out 2k? Is it noticeably better?

Bob44, 7:27 PM
I have not.

But its gonna be awhile before 4k

Cause gaming still not there

Yeah. Gpus are getting good, but increasing res and hz brings them back down to mediocre

Bob44, 7:28 PM
Yeah, but 4k can't even have 144hz yet

And it stresses out the VC more than 1080p or 2k

==================================================

Haha no worries
Yeah 3rd monitor, gaming specs would prob be overkill
Just need to drag some windows on it when I'm multitasking for work
